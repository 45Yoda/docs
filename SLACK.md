# Using Slack

Pixels Camp's organization provides a Slack instance to their approved attendees as yet another communication channel to help the community to take best from the event. This guide provides a policy and some guidelines on how to use Slack in this context.

### GENERAL

**What is Slack?**

Slack provides a rich text communication platform where its members and teams can exchange messages and files, public or privately, and interact with other services and applications. More about it [here][1]

**Who can use Pixel Camp's Slack**

Only approved Pixel Camp's participants are allowed to use its Slack. Each attendee receives an invitation and decides to use the app, or not.

**Do I really need to use this?**

No.

Slack is just another way for the organization and its partners to connect with the Pixels Camp community and support it, announce important messages, and foster discussion and creativity during the event. Hopefully, it will help and turn out to be a great instrument.

It is also a big social experiment, and we're not completely sure it will work. Who knows what can happen when you put one thousand highly skilled engineers and hackers in a room interacting in real time, right?

**I don't want to miss a beat, what are my other options?**

We use email for every critical message. We use a few social networks too. [Facebook][4] works nicely for general messages and announcements. We use [Instagram][3] because, er, it's cool and everyone loves great photos. Finally, we use [Twitter][2], our favorite, which is useful for real-time communication, announcements, and important messages. You should follow our [Twitter account][2] anyhow.

### CODE OF CONDUCT

**No shouting, please**

Hundreds of people in a chatroom can be quite noisy. Mostly, we want it to be useful. This means we have to be extra careful with anything that potentially triggers a notification, or ultimately, your precious attention. For caution, **@channel**, **@here** and **@everyone** are disabled to the public. When using the crowded default **#general** channel, please speak only when you have something to say.

**Jibber-jabber, can I?**

We understand. You get all excited with bots, memes, giphy images and tasteless jokes about programming languages you don't use or understand. We want you to express yourself in creative ways, even if no one is listening, so there's the #random channel for that. Go for it.

Optionally, you can create your own public or private channel and invite your pals to join you. That might work too.

**Announcements**

The organization provides you an official public **#announcements** channel. Subscribe to it when you log in. We'll use this channel to broadcast important messages before and during Pixels Camp.

### INVITES

**How do I get in?**

To get in, please fill up [this form][5]. Please remember that your email must match the one you used to apply to Pixels Camp (which should be the same as your Github account), and you must be an approved attendee already. Note that invites will be sent sequentially and as possible. Slack has strict [limitations][6] on the number of invites you can send per period of time.
